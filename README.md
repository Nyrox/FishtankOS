FishtankOS is a basic "operating system", in the sense that it implements the x86 boot sequence and can uses memory mapped VGA to display some text.

As it turns out though, anything non-trivial in OS dev gets really hard, really quickly and when I looked at the USB Spec I decided it's not worth it.
